# i3-blocks-contrib

A collection of useful blocks for [i3blocks](https://github.com/vivien/i3blocks), for the amazing [i3](https://i3wm.org) window manager.


## Configuration

Some examples on how to configure these in your `i3blocks` config file:

- @rosshadden's [i3blocks.conf](https://github.com/rosshadden/dotfiles/blob/master/src/.config/i3/i3blocks.conf)
- @oppenlander's [i3blocks.conf](https://github.com/oppenlander/dotfiles/blob/master/i3/i3blocks.conf)


## Contributing

As hinted by the name, this is intended to be openly contributed to by the community.
There is no official contributing guide, but please try to fit in to the style and themes found in our existing blocks.
We use a somewhat ad-hock [YUIDoc](http://yui.github.io/yuidoc/) documentation syntax.
